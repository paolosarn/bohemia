# BOHEMIA BACKLOG (the fleet's queue — read via THE GO PROCEDURE)

## *** FLEET-WIDE FREEZE (7/26, ART-FIRST RESET — read laws/BOHEMIA_ADDENDUM_
## ART_FIRST_RESET_7_26_26.md before ANY visual work): until Paolo approves a
## TARGET SCREEN, all NEW visual cooking outside the ART lane is frozen
## (integrating already-approved assets is fine; new pixels are not), and NO
## session surfaces quest questions or quest verdicts to Paolo. ***

## ART (new lane — first word "art")
1. THE TARGET SCREENS: 2-3 hand-assembled candidate fake screenshots of the
   walkable street level at its best (real character on a decorated street,
   2-tile doors, a dressed interior visible, approved assets as the base,
   coherent new tiles where needed, composed like a poster; SUN-mode judge,
   side-by-side). | Paolo picks one; the pick becomes the visual constitution
   + a target-match gate ships the same turn | nothing outside slices/judge
   surfaces | yes — THE verdict.
2. (after the pick) MASTER ACT-1 TILESET to the target, produced + judged as
   one assembled scene; act triptych variants in spec. | tileset gate +
   proportion gate (2-tile doors, human scale) | — | yes, as a set.

Rules (full doctrine: laws/BOHEMIA_AUTONOMY_DOCTRINE_7_26_26.md): topmost
unblocked item in YOUR lane; [PENDING Paolo] items are SKIPPED, never resolved;
only Paolo/verdicts add direction-class items; agents may append (discovered)
items; every item works to the Definition of Done. Entry shape:
GOAL | DoD beyond the standard | DON'T TOUCH | needs-verdict-before-volume?

## RUN  (LANE CHARTER CHANGED 7/26 — read
##       laws/BOHEMIA_ADDENDUM_THE_RUN_IS_THE_INTEGRATION_LANE_7_26_26.md first.
##       This lane INTEGRATES what the fleet built; it does not add features, and
##       the run's quest is disposable scaffolding, never judged.)
   [DONE 7/26] THE FIRST CONNECTED RUN — shipped, gated. Record:
   records/BOHEMIA_THE_FIRST_CONNECTED_RUN_7_26_26.txt.
   [DONE 7/26] THE REAL CAST — the run wears the real rig + wardrobe + face.
   Scoreboard: records/BOHEMIA_RUN_INTEGRATION_LEDGER_7_26_26.md (12/22),
   enforced by gates/integration_gate.js.
-1. THE 3/4 ISO VIEW (the loudest remaining "this isn't our game" gap, ledger
   priority 1). The CITY tab's human mode ALREADY renders the real iso world
   walking the real character — the run should adopt that renderer instead of
   growing a second one. Coordinate with CITY: this crosses into CITY_B64, so
   it needs the lane boundary agreed before it starts. | ledger row flips to
   INTEGRATED with a probe + a real-surface screenshot | CITY_B64 is the CITY
   lane's file | no.
0b. THE REAL VALLEY (ledger priority 2): the run's block becomes a real cell of
   the generated valley, so walking off it lands in a real district. | run_gate
   proves a second district reached on foot | district engines | no.
0c. DISTRICT ART / MUSIC / DAY CYCLE (ledger priorities 3-5), in that order.
0. SAVE/LOAD for the run (RULED 7/26, both addenda): sleep saves + free
   manual saves + autosave; death loads closest save; the save is ONE
   portable versioned blob (device prefs excluded) with export/import,
   per laws/BOHEMIA_ADDENDUM_SAVES_AND_CLOUD_7_26_26.md. | save->reload->
   identical state proven headless + export/import round-trip | engine/
   bohemia_loop.js (flag needs to WORLD) | no — fully ruled.
1. Phone-feel pass on the run (touch responsiveness at arm's length): real
   device-shaped viewports, hold-to-walk tuning, tap-to-step target sizes,
   the objective bar at arm's length. | run_gate extended with a real-device
   viewport pass | engine/bohemia_loop.js (flag needs to WORLD) | no.
2. (discovered) WIDEN THE RUN: the run is one seed-7 block. Walking off the
   block into the neighbouring district is the next real milestone — needs the
   world model's plot-to-plot transition, not new content. | run_gate proves a
   second district reached on foot | district engines (CITY lane owns them) | no.
3. (discovered) The player is not registered in ctx.scheduler, so the run's
   grid clock is the block sim's, not the loop's turn scheduler. Engine request
   for WORLD: a player actor the run can commit() through. | loop gate section
   | engine/bohemia_loop.js | no.
4. (discovered) Only S01 is wired into the run. Once placement is ruled, the
   other twenty canon quests should be reachable from a run surface too. |
   run_gate covers a second quest end to end | quest text | [PENDING Paolo
   placement].

## WORLD
LANE RULING (Paolo 7/26, LOCKED — laws/BOHEMIA_ADDENDUM_WORLD_BEFORE_QUESTS_7_26_26.md):
"we need to actually build a fucking world." This lane does NOT work on quests. Every
quest item is PARKED until Paolo himself reopens it. Build ground, not plumbing for
stories the world cannot host yet.

1. THE REST OF THE GROUND. Roads are done (arterial + freeway, 3,386 cells, valley now
   77% generated). Next: the 620 desert cells and the terrain that still renders flat
   (mountain/water/wash edges), then the NON-bespoke landmark placeholders (airport,
   rail, campus, town). | its own gate section or a terrain gate; render-and-look on
   the real MAP tab | the Strip / casinos / resorts stay Paolo's hand, never
   auto-generated | new ground LOOK = judge before volume.
2. AMBIENT ENCOUNTER DIRECTOR (APPROVED 7/26, records/BOHEMIA_VERDICT_ACT1_
   ROSTER_7_26_26.txt): the walk-surface encounter system — storyteller tension budget
   (never dice), 70/20/10 ambient/interactive/forced ratio, district+day/night spawn
   tables, rare-is-sacred caps, ~90s min gap. The 12 approved act-1 encounter types as
   spawnable tokens routing into the standard encounter handoff; patrols-collide as
   world-on-world. Enemy ART is NOT this item (approved-assets-first, separate judge).
   | director proven headless: ratios hold over a simulated long walk, no repeat-spam,
   deterministic per seed | pacing ruling (no background ticking when player idle) |
   design approved; art needs thumbs.
   NOTE: this is world content, not quest plumbing, so the 7/26 ruling does not park it.
3. INTERIORS FOR THE GROUND THAT HAS THEM: coordinate with CITY (they own the district
   interiors item) so nothing is built twice. | — | CITY lane's item 1 | no.
4. Engine support requests flagged by RUN (as they arrive, priority). | per request | — | no.
5. (discovered 7/26) VALLEY COMPOSITION: 70% of the built valley is suburb, and there are
   301 solar cells but 1 library, 1 firestation, 1 jail. Whether that is the city he wants
   is a DIRECTION call. | — | — | [PENDING Paolo].
6. (discovered 7/26) Faction bases are an even stride across the district list, so all 14
   factions sit on suburb tracts holding 1 cell each. Whether a faction's ground should
   match its trade is his call; the mechanism is a small change to bootFactions.
   | — | — | [PENDING Paolo].

PARKED BY THE 7/26 RULING (do not pick these up):
- P1. Quest placement picks -> apply as a casting-bridge override. The candidates shipped
  (all 21 quests after the QUESTS lane folded theirs in) and the judge page is live in
  the LIFE tab; it stays there, unjudged, unsurfaced.
- P2. World bridge deepening (quest outcomes moving factions on the map).

## CITY
1. INTERIOR PROPS FROM THE GREAT SWEEP (discovered, CITY 7/26). Interiors ship as
   a blessed but EMPTY shell: approved walls/doors/windows/floors, no furniture.
   The prop authority is banks/BOHEMIA_ACT1_CONFIRMED_SET_7_13_26.txt (2,604
   judged, 1,927 UP), keyed by (pack, idx) into banks/BOHEMIA_HD_TILE_REPO_part
   1-4. The app's TP_TILES is a DIFFERENT cut, keyed by category/index, and it is
   the raw un-swept corpus (sampling it put purple + neon in a house). Build the
   pack/idx -> app mapping, emit an UP-only interior prop pool, then dress rooms
   BY ROLE off the district dossiers ("registers + coolers + aisles up front",
   "rows of rusted lockers, a dead shower block"). | reusefirst + purity + the
   dead-world laws green with props on; interiors_gate extended to assert the
   prop pool is UP-only | never sample TP_TILES for shipped art | yes, fresh look.
2. MARRY COMMERCIAL (discovered, CITY 7/26). The corner plaza has NEVER been
   registered with the district kit (it never binds K, and the registration sits
   behind a `typeof K` guard that silently swallowed it), so the walked city
   still renders commercial from the LEGACY PREFAB STAMPS — not the canon plaza,
   nothing enterable. Binding K is one line and turns walkable_gate RED: on a
   single W or N street the generator builds only ONE store strip and parking
   fills the rest (drive 61% vs content 30%). Fix the mid-block/single-edge form
   FIRST, then bind K. Full numbers in the module's own head comment + records/
   BOHEMIA_INTERIORS_EVERYWHERE_7_26_26.md. | walkable_gate green with commercial
   swept + interiors_gate proves a plaza store is enterable | the S/corner form is
   approved, do not reshape it | the mid-block plaza form is [PENDING Paolo] per
   the module's own NOTES — surface it as rendered candidates, do not pick one.
3. GARAGE + CRYPT INTERIORS IN THE ALPHA (discovered, CITY 7/26). The engine
   DISPATCHES a building's interior by kind (garage -> multi-deck parking, crypt
   -> vault hall, everything else -> rooms) and world_gate proves it. The alpha's
   STEP-INSIDE renders the ROOMS kind only, so walking into a parking structure
   or a mausoleum gets you a floorplan instead of decks/vaults. Embed
   bohemia_garage.js + bohemia_crypt.js in CITY_B64 (resync tool exists now) and
   branch the render the way the engine branches. | interiors_gate extended to
   assert all three kinds render | engine dispatch is correct, do not touch it |
   the deck/vault LOOK = judge before volume.
4. Interiors everywhere: DONE 7/26 (records/BOHEMIA_INTERIORS_EVERYWHERE_7_26_26
   .md). Left standing: THE UNDERGROUND behind wash's sewer tunnel mouth is a
   LIFE-lane below-grade level, not a room in a footprint. [PENDING — LIFE lane]
5. District volume: next Pocket-City-type gaps that fit the dead world, on
   the KIT, full touchpoint list per the architecture map. | per-district gate
   x6 configs | bespoke strip/casino (Paolo's hand) | new district LOOK =
   judge before volume.
6. (discovered, coordinator 7/25) RIG_B64/PREFAB_B64 byte-lock holes + sync-
   canon gaps (PLOTGEN/POWERGRID/FLOORPLAN/TRANSITIONS). NON-COOK item. |
   new byte-lock gates registered | — | no.
   (CITY 7/26 note: tools/bohemia_city_module_resync.py now re-syncs every
   engine module inlined in CITY_B64 and `--check` reports staleness, which is
   the freshness half of this item for the CITY app. It caught commercial +
   suburb + district_kit all silently behind. The remaining half is the same
   treatment for RIG_B64/PREFAB_B64.)

## COMBAT
1a. DONE 7/26 (v67, straight from Paolo playing it): dial locked to the AUDIO
   clock + whole-bar cover cycles; suppression turn-based and legible; sprint
   costs stamina and the refill no longer refunds it; sprint/dash mutually
   exclusive with the armed move named on the ring. [PENDING Paolo] the cycle
   rebalance it forced: package 2 slowed 6->8 beats, package 3 quickened 6->4.
0. ALLY-IN-COMBAT foundation (RULED 7/26, companions addendum): the encounter
   system supports friendly combatants on the player's side — spawn, target
   correctly, go down but never permanently die. Mechanism only; WHO joins
   and companion personalities are Paolo's/quest canon. | proven headless: an
   ally fights alongside through the real bus, downed ally never deleted |
   CITY_B64 | no.
1. DONE 7/26 (v66): encounter handoff hardening for the RUN. Contract:
   laws/BOHEMIA_ADDENDUM_RUN_HANDOFF_CONTRACT_7_26_26.md. Quest context in,
   dead/spared/fled out, declared LEAK LIST, cold handoff with the tab never
   opened, READY queue, abort, loud errors, no splash. 5 back-to-back
   EXECUTED headless in combat_lab_gate sections 5-6, plus a real-surface
   Playwright proof. The cold handoff went 12.9s -> 14ms (blocking font).
2. Combat grammar graduation: stack candidates in ONE judge surface. | judge
   reachable from alpha, side-by-side anchors | — | yes (thumbs then build
   the winner).
3. (discovered 7/26, RUN lane's call) The alpha SHELL carries the same
   render-blocking cross-origin font link the combat demo did. Combat fixed
   its own blob only (lane discipline). Same one-line fix, whole-game boot
   payoff: `media="print" onload="this.media='all'"`. NON-COOK.
4. (discovered 7/26) The demo's melee/nerve loop re-rolls `pickRandomFaction`
   twice on a quest handoff (startGame + the shuffle hook). Harmless, same
   distribution, but it is duplicate work on the enter path. NON-COOK tidy.

## CHARACTER
1. (DONE 7/26 -- records/BOHEMIA_BODYVAR_SLIDERS_7_26_26.txt) ONE-RIG VARIATION
   SLIDERS. Shipped with gates/bodyvar_gate.js + a real-browser clip-set sweep.
   The RANGES are now waiting on Paolo's thumb; do not re-cook them, and do not
   wire per-NPC randomisation until he rules on it.
2. Wardrobe: new SHAPES (structure-not-color), taste-filtered before
   surfacing. | structure_gate | — | fresh shapes = thumbs.
3. Music pool volume in approved styles, taste-filtered. | music gates | — |
   fresh songs = thumbs.

## QUESTS
1. DONE 7/26 (S10-S21 shipped, corpus 9 -> 21, gate hardened with 5 new checks,
   laws/BOHEMIA_ADDENDUM_TWELVE_MORE_CANON_QUESTS_7_26_26.md). Sitting is live in
   the alpha: LIFE tab -> THE 12 NEW CANON QUESTS. Awaiting thumbs.
2. Act-1 main-quest beats from the locked lore (cold open -> flash-flood climax)
   drafted as .bq chains. START by querying records/BOHEMIA_QUESTBOOK_LAW_INDEX.json
   (QUEST STUDY LAW) and cite what you build from. | same bar as S10-S21, plus
   chain continuity proven headless | engine code, the alpha | yes.
2b. (discovered 7/26) The PORTS master is a 1,276-item BUILD QUEUE written for
   Bohemia by name and almost none of it is built. Mine it for the next quest
   batches instead of inventing shapes. NON-COOK triage first: list the ports
   that are already satisfied vs open. | the index makes this queryable | — | no.
3. (discovered 7/26) MULTI-QUEST CHAIN SUPPORT: nothing in the format or the
   runtime lets quest B read that quest A resolved (S09 -> S06 is a chain only in
   prose). Act-1 beats need it. NON-COOK item: a cross-quest flag surface on
   ctx.quests + a gate proving A's ending really opens B. | new gate section |
   the .bq format's no-stat-gates law is untouchable | no.
4. (discovered 7/26) The batch plants unread flags (opened_the_deep,
   aired_the_method, killed_the_token, walked_them_out, owes_the_cartel,
   sold_the_forger). Nothing consumes them. Wiring them to world beats is
   [PENDING Paolo] at the canon level; the mechanism half is item 3.

## SHARED / ANY IDLE SESSION (non-cook)
1. VERDICT TOOLING upgrade per the doctrine: one AGGREGATED judge page across
   lanes grouped by discipline, side-by-side anchors, APPROVE/CBB/KILL
   buttons, kill-reason tags, .txt export. | replaces per-lane judge sprawl;
   gate: the page exists + exports parse | — | no (tooling, not art).
2. [PRIORITY UP 7/26, Paolo direct order — approved-assets-first addendum]
   CANON EXEMPLAR INDEX + KILL-REASON TAXONOMY distilled from banks +
   graveyard post-mortems (machine-readable; cooking tools cite which
   exemplar anchored each cook). | reusefirst-style gate extension | — | no.
3. DRIFT CANARY harness: re-render fixed approved anchors, diff vs blessed.
   | canary gate registered | — | no.
