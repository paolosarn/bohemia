# BOHEMIA BACKLOG (the fleet's queue — read via THE GO PROCEDURE)

## *** FLEET-WIDE FREEZE (7/26, ART-FIRST RESET — read laws/BOHEMIA_ADDENDUM_
## ART_FIRST_RESET_7_26_26.md). *** BOTH FREEZES ARE LIFTED AS OF 7/26. ***
## Paolo verdicted the target screen CBB, so the visual constitution EXISTS:
## records/target/BOHEMIA_VISUAL_CONSTITUTION.json, held by
## gates/target_match_gate.py. Every lane may cook new pixels again, and quest
## asks may be surfaced again. THE PRICE: every cook now passes the proxy gates
## (palette ceiling, per-layer value bands, no keyline, no dither, one light
## direction, hashable seam contracts) and every new art bank REGISTERS itself
## in target_match_gate.py's BANKS list. CBB also means the target itself is
## FROZEN and byte-locked - nobody makes another target screen. Verdict record:
## records/BOHEMIA_TARGET_SCREEN_VERDICT_7_26_26.txt ***

## LAB (THE REFERENCE LAB — first word "lab"; law: laws/BOHEMIA_ADDENDUM_
## THE_REFERENCE_LAB_7_26_26.md. One session = one system = one named game.)
0. [RULED 7/26] THE LANE'S ASSIGNMENT CHANGED MID-DAY. Paolo: "who said I
   wanted to test the walking... it was supposed to be like the actual game and
   all its mechanics... you need to get the code online and implement it for the
   different game mechanics like marriage and fishing in farming". Law:
   laws/BOHEMIA_ADDENDUM_LAB_IS_WHOLE_MECHANICS_7_26_26.md — an emulation is
   THREE OR MORE NAMED MECHANICS, each playable end to end, from the real source.
   Movement/camera/collision/lighting are plumbing and can never be a lab
   deliverable again; the gate fails a row that declares one. He also RULED
   Bohemia's movement in the same breath
   (laws/BOHEMIA_ADDENDUM_TIME_IS_SPENT_BY_ACTIONS_7_26_26.md): the world moves
   when you spend time taking an action. That closed LAB-1's open question.
1d. [SHIPPED 7/26, ON HIS ORDER] THE FIRST PORT OUT OF THE LAB.
   Paolo after playing LAB-03: "Awesome! All these things worked. Very good! Did
   you learn anything. Anything we can throw in the bohemia code right now?"
   Law: laws/BOHEMIA_ADDENDUM_LAB_PORTS_ON_HIS_WORD_7_26_26.md — the lab ports
   only when he says so, ships MECHANISM ONLY in its own new file, never wires
   itself into another lane's surface, and carries its provenance.
   engine/bohemia_resolve.js (headless, no deps, collides with nothing):
     RESOLVE  one moment, a DECLARED phase order, and no system able to read
              another's report. A step that throws cannot eat the player's night.
     RATION   a limit by COUNT per day and per week with a bypass that overrides
              both (the birthday shape). No price term exists anywhere in it.
     CEILING  points cannot pass the current state's cap and ONLY a state change
              moves the cap. 500 favours cannot grind past a wall.
     REACH    one declared range, one facing rule, one predicate.
   AMENDED THE SAME TURN BY HIS RULING: "I like it all tbh all 3 and sleep
   understand sleep can be hangout or eat too u know" — APPROVE on all four, and
   the resolve moment is ANY BLOCK OF TIME THE PLAYER SPENDS, not just sleep.
   Law: laws/BOHEMIA_ADDENDUM_THE_MOMENT_IS_ANY_SPENT_BLOCK_7_26_26.md. The
   resolver now takes a CALLER-DECLARED list of moments each carrying a SIZE, a
   system declares WHICH moments it answers, and an undeclared moment is a build
   error. A meal moves less than a night because each system says so, not because
   the module hardcoded a night. Verdict: records/BOHEMIA_LAB_PORT_VERDICT_7_26_26.txt
   Gate: gates/resolve_gate.js, 77 checks, registered as LAB PORT, and
   mutation-tested (breaking the clamp, leaking reports between steps, letting a
   thrown step kill the moment, ignoring a moment subscription, leaking the moment
   through the shared context, or accepting an undeclared moment each turn it red).
   EVERY TABLE IS EMPTY. No ration limits, no faction thresholds, no reach number
   and no action costs for any real Bohemia system: callers pass them in, and the
   first default is a RULING, not code. NOT WIRED INTO ANY SURFACE — adopting it
   is the owning lane's build item (RUN for the contextual verb + reach, WORLD for
   the resolve point, LIFE/SOCIAL for the ration and the standing ceiling).
1c. [SHIPPED 7/26 — AWAITING PAOLO'S PLAY] ONE WORLD, ALL THREE MECHANICS ON IT.
   Paolo: "are you able to code these into the walkable version of Stardew Valley
   made earlier pull up to the mini lake you can start fishing pull up on your
   potential spouse. Do all of this pull up on your farm."
   slices/lab/BOHEMIA_LAB_STARDEW_WORLD_7_26_26.html — one town, one clock, one
   purse. Your farmhouse and a 54-tile fenced plot, the shop up the road, a lake
   with a dock, EMILY walking a real schedule. ONE contextual action button:
   CAST at water, USE TOOL at soil, TALK next to her, SLEEP at your bed, HOLD TO
   REEL once a fish is on, and the tile you are about to act on is outlined.
   Sleeping is the only integration point: crops advance or stall, soil dries,
   her friendship decays, the wedding counts down, her schedule resets.
   What the merge taught (the actual finding):
   records/lab/BOHEMIA_LAB_STARDEW_WORLD_NOTE_7_26_26.md — the walk is a sentence
   structure not a feature; one contextual verb instead of a button per system;
   reach is a declared number; ONE resolve point with zero coupling between
   systems; distance on the map IS the pacing. Gate: 179 checks, and the world
   half WALKS the route with the real movement code (door -> plot -> till/seed/
   water -> across the map to the dock -> land a fish -> up to her -> bouquet ->
   home -> in the door -> bed -> sleep -> the crop advanced).
   His musing "in our world it's gonna most likely be like a Hydro farm pool or
   something I don't know but yeah" is RECORDED AND NOT ACTED ON. No Bohemia
   growing system invented. If he rules it, it becomes a CITY/WORLD item.
1b. [SHIPPED 7/26 — AWAITING PAOLO'S PLAY] STARDEW MECHANICS: FISHING + FARMING
   + MARRIAGE, all three playable end to end in
   slices/lab/BOHEMIA_LAB_STARDEW_MECHANICS_7_26_26.html. The real bobber-bar
   physics (bar height IS the entire fishing skill tree); till/seed/water/sleep/
   harvest/regrow with the real reasons a crop stalls (dry = a wasted day, not
   damage) or dies (wrong season); and stranger -> friend -> dating -> engaged ->
   married on the real point economy (250/heart, gifts rationed 1/day + 2/week,
   birthday x8, neglect -2/-8/-20, and the HARD 8-heart cap that gifting cannot
   pass). Teardown with every file:line:
   records/lab/BOHEMIA_LAB_STARDEW_MECHANICS_TEARDOWN_7_26_26.txt. Patterns +
   what Bohemia should take: records/lab/BOHEMIA_LAB_STARDEW_MECHANICS_PATTERN_
   NOTE_7_26_26.md (10 named patterns, 7 recommendations, 4 do-not-ports).
   Gate: 112 checks that PLAY all three loops.
1. [SUPERSEDED 7/26 by item 0 — kept as the record, not a template] STARDEW
   TOWN-WALK FEEL. All three
   deliverables landed: slices/lab/BOHEMIA_LAB_STARDEW_TOWNWALK_7_26_26.html
   (one town, two furnished interiors, fade transitions, the 7s/10min clock with
   the real dusk curve, one scheduled NPC),
   records/lab/BOHEMIA_LAB_STARDEW_TOWNWALK_FEEL_LEDGER_7_26_26.txt (37
   constants, each with the decompiled file:line it was read from) and
   records/lab/BOHEMIA_LAB_STARDEW_TOWNWALK_PATTERN_NOTE_7_26_26.md (9 port
   candidates, 4 explicit do-not-ports). Gate: gates/lab_gate.js, 83 checks,
   registered as REFERENCE LAB. The verdict is Paolo playing it; the lane ports
   nothing on its own. ONE [PENDING Paolo] came out of it and is written into
   the note: Bohemia's 120 BPM / one-body-per-cell walk and Stardew's continuous
   sub-pixel walk cannot both live in one surface — three options are laid out,
   all three are his call.
2. [SHIPPED 7/26 — AWAITING PAOLO'S PLAY] ZOMBOID LOOT LOOP. His ask:
   "containers, search, weight, the tension of rummaging a house."
   slices/lab/BOHEMIA_LAB_ZOMBOID_HOUSE_7_26_26.html — a four-room house with 12
   containers, and PROJECT ZOMBOID'S OWN LOOT DATA EMBEDDED VERBATIM from the
   vanilla Lua (4 rooms, 18 container slots, 65 tables, trimmed to the top 12
   items and top 6 junk per table, no weight altered). Three mechanics:
     LOOTING     the real two-stage roll. The ROOM plus the CONTAINER TYPE pick
                 named tables by weightChance out of 100; each table rolls its
                 weighted item list AND its own SEPARATE JUNK table. The junk is
                 why rummaging feels like rummaging.
     RUMMAGING   the real time formula (ISInventoryTransferAction.lua:784-833):
                 weight IS time, capped at 3kg; organising costs 120 base against
                 50 for grabbing; traits are flat x0.5 / x2.0 on everything.
     ENCUMBRANCE the fullness tax, and I HAD IT BACKWARDS AT FIRST: the source
                 only applies it when BOTH containers are on your body. Grabbing
                 off a shelf is FLAT. PACKING is what a full bag taxes, up to
                 2.4x. Zomboid charges you for organising, not for grabbing. The
                 page models the real two-step loop: take into hands, then pack.
   Teardown with every file:line + the correction stated plainly:
   records/lab/BOHEMIA_LAB_ZOMBOID_TEARDOWN_7_26_26.txt
   Patterns (8 named, 5 recommendations, 4 do-not-ports):
   records/lab/BOHEMIA_LAB_ZOMBOID_PATTERN_NOTE_7_26_26.md
   Gate: lab_gate.js is now 245 checks; the Zomboid half walks the house, rolls
   40 counters to prove the junk roll, measures the weight cap and both trait
   multipliers, proves grabbing is flat while packing scales, and plays both
   loops to a full bag.
3. (Paolo adds more targets by naming a game + system to any lab session or
   to the coordinator.)

## ART (new lane — first word "art")
-1. (discovered 7/26) FLEET: TWO SESSIONS BUILT THE SAME THING IN THE SAME HOUR.
   ART and RUN both wired the frozen tileset into the run; RUN landed first and
   ART binned its duplicate. "Check main before you start" does not help when
   the other lane lands mid-turn. Needs a real mechanism (a claim/lock on a file
   or a system, visible across sessions), not a promise. NOT designed here -
   fleet process is not this lane's to invent. Record:
   records/BOHEMIA_ART_LANE_COLLISION_7_26_26.md
0. [SHIPPED 7/26] STEP ZERO — THE MOBILE RENDER CONTRACT (amendment D):
   laws/BOHEMIA_MOBILE_RENDER_CONTRACT_7_26_26.md. Pins frame, tile px, integer
   zoom, portrait viewport, proportion canon, ONE light direction, the three
   value bands, no-keyline, no-dither, the pipeline rule and the memory
   constraint. Every number is asserted against the factory's own constants by
   target_screen_gate.py, so contract and code cannot drift. TWO CLAUSES ARE
   HONESTLY UNMET AND SAY SO IN THE DOC: (a) the 64-colour master ramp is
   DERIVED (records/target/BOHEMIA_MASTER_PALETTE.json) but the approved corpus
   is continuous-tone, 59,377 colours across the plates — indexing lands with
   the act-1 tileset (item 2) and is held meanwhile by a ratchet ceiling;
   (b) live canvas memory vs the ~224MB iOS floor is NOT instrumented and the
   gate does not pretend to check it. Order note: amendment D landed on main
   mid-session, so the contract was written FROM the screens, not before them.
0b. (discovered 7/26, needs instrumentation) MEASURE LIVE CANVAS MEMORY on a
   real device against the ~224MB iOS floor. Until then section 8 of the
   contract is a constraint, not a check. | a probe + a gated ceiling | — | no.
1. [CLOSED 7/26 - CBB, SHIPPED, FROZEN] THE TARGET SCREEN. Paolo: "Could be
   better." Per the verdict pipeline that is SHIPS + FROZEN + NEVER SPAWNS
   VARIANTS. The tile-reassembled frame IS the target; it and the 42-tile
   starter set are byte-locked in the constitution and changing either needs a
   NEW RULING, not a new render. DO NOT MAKE ANOTHER TARGET SCREEN. All further
   look work happens in the act-1 tileset against this target. Verdict:
   records/BOHEMIA_TARGET_SCREEN_VERDICT_7_26_26.txt. Constitution +
   target-match gate shipped the same turn (215 checks).
   [HISTORY] Amendment C (ANTI-BIOSHOCK) was run for the first time and the mockup
   FAILED it: the painted plate cut into 262 unique tiles for 264 cells - it was
   never a tiled world. Fixed: banks/BOHEMIA_STARTER_TILESET_ACT1_7_26_26.txt is
   a real, bounded, NAMED 38-tile set (+11 sprites + cast-shadow DATA), the frame
   is re-laid from nothing but those tiles, and it renders on a real browser
   canvas with integer blit and smoothing off. The first reassembly looked worse
   and the four reasons were specific: no wall corners, a hip roof laid as flat
   stripes, no runtime cast shadows, no gaps between buildings. All four fixed.
   Delta from the painting is now 34/255, essentially all of it the two poster
   passes that belong to the renderer. THE TILE-REASSEMBLED FRAME IS NOW THE
   TARGET and the judge page leads with it. Record:
   records/BOHEMIA_REASSEMBLY_TEST_7_26_26.md. Gate: 1,074 checks, including a
   hard 96-tile ceiling. Backlog item 2 (MASTER ACT-1 TILESET) is now partly
   delivered: this IS the starter set; what remains is the act triptych and
   palette indexing.
   [PRIOR ROUND] THE TARGET SCREEN.
   REV 3 answers the marked-up shot: the nameless bottom band, the fake
   chain-link and the fake power line are DELETED (invented decoration is
   deleted on sight); the radioactive barrel is a plain rusted drum and
   radiation/hazard iconography is now BANNED BY LORE everywhere; the crossing
   spans kerb to kerb with its bars across traffic, lined up with its walk; the
   front door shares a column with its own walk; the garage door is a real
   opening with the driveway running into it; the lamps are the slim blessed
   post, a tile taller and not one pixel wider; and two objects can no longer
   stand on the same ground - the BUILD FAILS. NEW LAW + gate:
   laws/BOHEMIA_ADDENDUM_NAME_IT_OR_DONT_DRAW_IT_7_26_26.md - every thing on
   screen is named, described, sourced, and the build dies if the drawn count
   ever exceeds the named count. Manifest ships with the render and is printed
   on the judge page. Gate: 483 checks.
   [PRIOR ROUND] THE TARGET SCREEN. Paolo:
   "Front base is the only one I'm concerned with and even then it looks like
   hallucinated AI slop. We made a rule that all cars are 2 x 3 tiles. Yeah the
   roofs are all fucked up not put on correctly yeah." A THE FRONT FACE is the
   direction; B and C are GRAVEYARDED (registry + post-mortem in
   records/BOHEMIA_TARGET_SCREEN_RULING_7_26_26.md) and their renderers were
   DELETED, not disabled. REV 2 fixes both named defects at the root: cars are
   sized from engine/bohemia_prop_scale.js at draw time (never a typed number)
   and turned along the road they died on; SHEAR is 0 forever, so a roof sits
   square on its own walls and is a real hip form (ridge, hip ends in the roof's
   own material, fascia, eave shadow). Judge page is now ONE TAP: GOOD ENOUGH /
   COULD BE BETTER / STILL SLOP, with both fixes shown under a tile grid.
   Gate: 91 checks. STILL OPEN: whether the LOOK is there. If it comes back
   STILL SLOP the named next suspects are the one-tan value range, the unindexed
   palette, and boxes-instead-of-massing. Do not act on those before he rules.
1-OLD. [superseded] the three-candidate sitting
   (A THE FRONT FACE / B THE ISO BLOCK / C THE CUTAWAY), each side-by-side with
   a real screenshot of the shipped run, judged from alpha -> LIFE -> PICK THE
   TARGET SCREEN. Built entirely from approved banks; the body is baked by the
   alpha itself. Record: records/BOHEMIA_TARGET_SCREENS_7_26_26.md. Gate:
   target_screen_gate.py (63 checks, registered) — it holds 2-tile doors, human
   scale, three-tone/no-keyline, dead-dark glass, and law 4's quest-ask freeze.
   NOTE: they were composed BEFORE amendment D landed on main, so item 0's
   MOBILE RENDER CONTRACT is written FROM them (records/target/BOHEMIA_TARGET_
   SPEC.json already pins resolution, tile px, integer scale, portrait viewport,
   light direction and the three-tone/no-outline rule) rather than the other way
   round. Amendments B+C (cut-and-reassemble acceptance, proxy gates) attach at
   the moment of the pick, not before it.
1b. (blocked on the pick) WRITE THE PICK IN: status PICKED in the spec, losers
   to the graveyard with a post-mortem, target-match diffing on, proxy gates +
   the cut-and-reassemble acceptance test per amendments B+C, freeze lifted.
2. (after the pick) MASTER ACT-1 TILESET to the target. INTERIOR COMPOSITION
   SOURCE (7/26): records/BOHEMIA_ROOM_RECIPE_BOOK_7_26_26.md — 12 room
   recipes + composition laws + the 70/20/10 dead-world translation,
   [PENDING Paolo bulk verdict]; on APPROVE, rooms are composed FROM the
   recipes (manifests mapped to the interior pool), never invented.
   INGREDIENT DELIVERED
   7/26 by CITY: banks/BOHEMIA_INTERIOR_POOL_7_26_26.txt - Paolo's Great Sweep
   crossed to real images for the first time (all 87 swept packs resolve against
   the HD masters, 0 unresolved), filtered UP-ONLY, 465 tiles bucketed by room
   function with per-tile draw scale from the sweep's BIG/SMALL flags. Built by
   tools/bohemia_interior_pool_factory.py; re-run it with different caps for a
   bigger set. Bodies/gore excluded on purpose (UP, but a story Paolo places).
   Deliberately NOT wired into the game - the freeze and TILESETS-ARE-SETS say a
   look is judged as one assembled scene, after the pick. produced + judged as
   one assembled scene; act triptych variants in spec. | tileset gate +
   proportion gate (2-tile doors, human scale — the proportion half already
   ships inside target_screen_gate.py) | — | yes, as a set.
3. [RETIRED 7/26 - the work is dead, not done] RE-COOK VEHICLES TO ISO. This was
   only ever needed if candidate B or C won. A won and both are graveyarded, so
   the approved car art is already in the right projection. Removing it rather
   than leaving it to rot at the bottom of the lane.
3b. [PENDING Paolo, carried] THE CAR LENGTH. At true pixel scale the approved
   wreck art is ~2 tiles wide by >4 long, against his locked 2x3 footprint.
   Either the art is re-cooked shorter or the footprint becomes 2x5. Not a
   guess I get to make.

Rules (full doctrine: laws/BOHEMIA_AUTONOMY_DOCTRINE_7_26_26.md): topmost
unblocked item in YOUR lane; [PENDING Paolo] items are SKIPPED, never resolved;
only Paolo/verdicts add direction-class items; agents may append (discovered)
items; every item works to the Definition of Done. Entry shape:
GOAL | DoD beyond the standard | DON'T TOUCH | needs-verdict-before-volume?

## RUN  (LANE CHARTER CHANGED 7/26 — read
##       laws/BOHEMIA_ADDENDUM_THE_RUN_IS_THE_INTEGRATION_LANE_7_26_26.md first.
##       This lane INTEGRATES what the fleet built; it does not add features, and
##       the run's quest is disposable scaffolding, never judged.)
A. [FILED BY VERDICT 7/26 — records/BOHEMIA_LAB_PORT_VERDICT_7_26_26.txt] ADOPT THE
   ONE CONTEXTUAL VERB AND THE DECLARED REACH. Paolo APPROVED both, so this needs
   no further ask. engine/bohemia_resolve.js ships makeReach(tiles) + facingTile:
   one range, one facing rule, one predicate. The run currently has a talk trigger
   AND a door bump AND separate buttons; fold them into ONE button whose label
   comes from what you face, exactly as the lab world does (CAST / USE TOOL / TALK
   / SLEEP), with the target tile outlined so the button is never a mystery. It
   REMOVES UI rather than adding it, which is what a phone wants.
   [PENDING Paolo] HOW MANY TILES OF REACH. Do not pick it. The lab used 1 in a
   reference page; that is not a ruling.
   [DONE 7/26] THE FIRST CONNECTED RUN — shipped, gated. Record:
   records/BOHEMIA_THE_FIRST_CONNECTED_RUN_7_26_26.txt.
   [DONE 7/26] THE REAL CAST — the run wears the real rig + wardrobe + face.
   [DONE 7/26] REAL ANIMATED DOORS (2 tiles tall, approved 7/13 bank) + MUSIC
   (the alpha's own synth scores the walk). Law:
   laws/BOHEMIA_ADDENDUM_DOOR_LAW_TWO_TILES_TALL_7_26_26.md.
   [DONE 7/26] SAVE / LOAD — one portable versioned blob (sleep + manual +
   autosave, export/import code, no device prefs inside, old versions migrate
   forward) and DEATH IS A RELOAD wired to it.
   [DONE 7/26] THE OVERWORLD LOOK — the block is laid from the FROZEN starter
   tileset of Paolo's CBB target. Consumed, never re-rendered; the builder
   refuses to ship if the bank md5 moves. CORRECTION ON RECORD: the target he
   picked is TOP-DOWN, so this lane's old "the run must go 3/4 iso" premise was
   wrong and is retired.
   Scoreboard: records/BOHEMIA_RUN_INTEGRATION_LEDGER_7_26_26.md (17/24),
   enforced by gates/integration_gate.js.
-1. INTERIORS TO THE TARGET (new top item). The outside now speaks the
   constitution; inside is still flat role-tinted plates. CITY already delivered
   the ingredient and deliberately left it unwired for exactly this:
   banks/BOHEMIA_INTERIOR_POOL_7_26_26.txt (465 swept-UP tiles bucketed by room
   function, with per-tile draw scale). | interiors laid from the pool, target-
   match proxies green, real-surface screenshot | the pool is CITY's artifact,
   consume it, do not re-cook it | yes, fresh look.
0b. THE REAL VALLEY (ledger priority 2): the run's block becomes a real cell of
   the generated valley, so walking off it lands in a real district. | run_gate
   proves a second district reached on foot | district engines | no.
0c. DISTRICT ART / MUSIC / DAY CYCLE (ledger priorities 3-5), in that order.
1. Phone-feel pass on the run (touch responsiveness at arm's length): real
   device-shaped viewports, hold-to-walk tuning, tap-to-step target sizes,
   the objective bar at arm's length. | run_gate extended with a real-device
   viewport pass | engine/bohemia_loop.js (flag needs to WORLD) | no.
2. (discovered) WIDEN THE RUN: the run is one seed-7 block. Walking off the
   block into the neighbouring district is the next real milestone — needs the
   world model's plot-to-plot transition, not new content. | run_gate proves a
   second district reached on foot | district engines (CITY lane owns them) | no.
3. (discovered) The player is not registered in ctx.scheduler, so the run's
   grid clock is the block sim's, not the loop's turn scheduler. Engine request
   for WORLD: a player actor the run can commit() through. | loop gate section
   | engine/bohemia_loop.js | no.
4. (discovered) Only S01 is wired into the run. Once placement is ruled, the
   other twenty canon quests should be reachable from a run surface too. |
   run_gate covers a second quest end to end | quest text | [PENDING Paolo
   placement].

## WORLD
0. THE ONE MAP (Paolo direction, 7/26: "combine the phone map to the city
   builder map with quest locations on top"): the in-game PHONE's map app
   renders THE SAME city-builder valley map (one map, one truth — same
   philosophy as zoom-build), with QUEST LOCATION markers layered on top
   (use the live casting-bridge locations now; placement-verdict overrides
   apply later when Paolo picks). Coordinate with RUN on how the phone
   surfaces in the run. | the phone map IS the valley map with quest pins,
   proven on the real surface | CITY_B64 render internals stay CITY's |
   no — Paolo-directed.
A. [FILED BY VERDICT 7/26 — records/BOHEMIA_LAB_PORT_VERDICT_7_26_26.txt] ADOPT THE
   RESOLVE POINT. Paolo APPROVED it and RULED its shape in the same breath: "sleep
   can be hangout or eat too u know" — the world resolves at ANY BLOCK OF TIME THE
   PLAYER SPENDS, and sleep is only the biggest one. Law:
   laws/BOHEMIA_ADDENDUM_THE_MOMENT_IS_ANY_SPENT_BLOCK_7_26_26.md
   engine/bohemia_resolve.js ships the machinery: a resolver takes a declared list
   of moments each carrying a size, a system declares which moments it answers, an
   undeclared moment is a build error, systems cannot read each other, and one
   broken system cannot eat the time the player spent. Register the world's systems
   as steps (territory, who noticed you, the overnight feed, decay) and run them at
   a spent block instead of scattering them across the tick.
   [PENDING Paolo] THE MOMENT TABLE: which moments exist beyond his three examples
   and HOW LONG EACH SPENDS. And the action cost table. Do not invent either.
LANE RULING (Paolo 7/26, LOCKED — laws/BOHEMIA_ADDENDUM_WORLD_BEFORE_QUESTS_7_26_26.md):
"we need to actually build a fucking world." This lane does NOT work on quests. Every
quest item is PARKED until Paolo himself reopens it. Build ground, not plumbing for
stories the world cannot host yet.

0. [DONE 7/26, freeze lifted] THE FIVE SURFACES CONFORM TO THE VISUAL CONSTITUTION.
   Built during the freeze and flagged PROVISIONAL SKIN; the moment Paolo ruled the
   target CBB they were measured against it and the 5 out-of-band palette entries
   (road paint, crosswalks, stop bars, the lake ring) were toned into their layer's
   value band. Locked by a CONSTITUTION CONFORMANCE section in roadcell_gate and
   terrain_gate, which read the constitution at run time. Any NEW cook in this lane
   passes the same section plus the fleet's proxy gates, and any new art BANK
   registers itself in target_match_gate.py.
0c. [DONE 7/26] STREAMING: bounded LRU plot cache (64 cells) + w.stream() warming the
   ring ahead of the body + the walk surface streaming before it steps. Walking the
   valley used to grow without limit toward ~1.8 GB; it is now flat, and a boundary
   crossing costs 0.03 ms. Gate: STREAMING. RESIDUAL for a SURFACE lane (not WORLD):
   the ~30-40 ms first-touch of a fresh cell wants an idle callback or a worker inside
   the run/city frame loop.
0b. [PENDING Paolo] ACT TRIPTYCH for the five surfaces: act-2 recovering and act-3
   rebuilt materials. Content, his call, recorded in every dossier.
1. DONE 7/26: THE GROUND IS BUILT. Roads (arterial 2,434 + freeway 952) and terrain
   (mountain 927 + desert 620 + water 74) all generate real ground on one continuous
   valley-wide noise field. Valley: 40% -> 95% generated. Gates ROAD CELLS + TERRAIN.
   WHAT IS LEFT UNBUILT, in order of size, and it is all LANDMARK work now:
     a. airbase 54, airport 40 (one generator, an airfield kit: runways, aprons,
        hangars, taxiways) | its own gate | — | new ground LOOK = judge before volume.
     b. rail 90 + interchange 16 (rail corridor cells + freeway-to-freeway ramps;
        both are network tiles like the roads, same machinery) | roadcell_gate
        extended | — | no.
     c. campus 16, town 9, speedway 12, ballpark 8, convention 6, datafort 6,
        prison 4, dam 4, basin 8, reservoir 3 (small landmark set, one at a time).
     d. NEVER AUTO-GENERATED, by law: strip 81, resort 118, casino 5, luxor, sphere,
        strat, highroller, sign. Paolo's hand. Leave them reserved.
2. AMBIENT ENCOUNTER DIRECTOR (APPROVED 7/26, records/BOHEMIA_VERDICT_ACT1_
   ROSTER_7_26_26.txt): the walk-surface encounter system — storyteller tension budget
   (never dice), 70/20/10 ambient/interactive/forced ratio, district+day/night spawn
   tables, rare-is-sacred caps, ~90s min gap. The 12 approved act-1 encounter types as
   spawnable tokens routing into the standard encounter handoff; patrols-collide as
   world-on-world. Enemy ART is NOT this item (approved-assets-first, separate judge).
   | director proven headless: ratios hold over a simulated long walk, no repeat-spam,
   deterministic per seed | pacing ruling (no background ticking when player idle) |
   design approved; art needs thumbs.
   NOTE: this is world content, not quest plumbing, so the 7/26 ruling does not park it.
3. INTERIORS FOR THE GROUND THAT HAS THEM: coordinate with CITY (they own the district
   interiors item) so nothing is built twice. | — | CITY lane's item 1 | no.
4. [DONE 7/26] Engine support for RUN, request 1 of 2: THE VALLEY TILE + CROSSING
   (world.tile / solidAt / step / walk / route). The run can now ask the world model for
   any tile in the valley and walk across cell boundaries on real ground; gate CROSSING
   proves district -> street -> district on foot. RUN's ledger priority 2 is unblocked.
   [DONE 7/26] request 2 of 2 as well: THE WALK SURFACE
   (Loop.makeWalkSurface + ctx.walk) — a player actor in a real loop scheduler in
   valley tile space, blocked by the world's own tiles, with commit/routeTo/follow.
   Gate CROSSING is 22 checks and walks it end to end. RUN item 3 is unblocked.
5. Further engine support requests flagged by RUN (as they arrive, priority). | per
   request | — | no.
5. (discovered 7/26) VALLEY COMPOSITION: 70% of the built valley is suburb, and there are
   301 solar cells but 1 library, 1 firestation, 1 jail. Whether that is the city he wants
   is a DIRECTION call. | — | — | [PENDING Paolo].
6. (discovered 7/26) Faction bases are an even stride across the district list, so all 14
   factions sit on suburb tracts holding 1 cell each. Whether a faction's ground should
   match its trade is his call; the mechanism is a small change to bootFactions.
   | — | — | [PENDING Paolo].

PARKED BY THE 7/26 RULING (do not pick these up):
- P1. Quest placement picks -> apply as a casting-bridge override. The candidates shipped
  (all 21 quests after the QUESTS lane folded theirs in) and the judge page is live in
  the LIFE tab; it stays there, unjudged, unsurfaced.
- P2. World bridge deepening (quest outcomes moving factions on the map).

## LIFE / SOCIAL
A. [FILED BY VERDICT 7/26 — records/BOHEMIA_LAB_PORT_VERDICT_7_26_26.txt] ADOPT THE
   RATION AND THE STANDING CEILING. Paolo APPROVED both.
   RATION (engine/bohemia_resolve.js makeRation): limit favours, posts and gifts by
   COUNT per day and per week, NEVER by money. A priced limit stops mattering the
   moment the player is rich; a rationed one never does. The bypass slot is the
   birthday shape: an occasion that ignores both windows and can pay a multiplier.
   CEILING (makeCeiling): faction standing gets a WALL you cannot grind through.
   You reach it by doing jobs and you only pass it by COMMITTING (taking a side,
   burning a bridge), and neglect gets more expensive the deeper in you are.
   [PENDING Paolo] THE NUMBERS: how many favours per week, where each faction wall
   sits, what commitment moves it, what neglect costs per rung. Do not invent them.

## CITY
0. [DONE 7/26] THE WALKED WORLD WAS RESAMPLED AT EVERY ZOOM. Found by
   MEASUREMENT (tools/bohemia_render_audit.js patches the canvas before the app
   boots and records every real draw), not by reading code. 41% of all draws
   upscaled by x1.375 - the chunk bake was 16px/cell while the default zoom is
   22, so the ENTIRE ground plane was resampled, and the zoom ladder
   [11,22,44,88] is a clean power-of-two family that was being divided by the
   wrong base. 44% more landed on a half pixel because the canvas takes its CSS
   client height and an odd height puts .5 in the camera origin. Fixed:
   tools/bohemia_city_pixelfix_patch.py (TPX 16->22, whole-pixel camera, and
   canvases given their own 64-entry LRU so the bigger bake cannot blow the
   ~224MB iOS floor). Result 41% -> 0.1% and 44% -> 3.4%. Locked by
   gates/render_pixel_gate.js, a RATCHET measured on the real surface.
0a. (discovered 7/26) PRE-SCALE THE DISTRICT HEROES. 732 draws per walk push a
   ~266x172 hero image into a ~20x13 slot - a 13:1 minification done every
   frame. Smoothing is the RIGHT call at that ratio so the look is fine; the
   waste is doing it every frame instead of once. Cache one pre-scaled copy per
   hero per zoom: identical output, a fraction of the work. | render_pixel_gate
   ratchet on the smoothed count once it drops | the city-builder overview is a
   surface Paolo LIKES - identical output or do not touch it | no.
1. [BLOCKED ON THE TARGET PICK] DRESS THE INTERIORS. Paolo killed the first
   interiors ("Dogshit.") and the diagnosis is empty rooms: the shell is lawful
   approved art but it is five textures and no furniture. The furniture is ready
   (banks/BOHEMIA_INTERIOR_POOL_7_26_26.txt, UP-only, bucketed by room function)
   and the role->bucket mapping is written in
   records/BOHEMIA_INTERIOR_KILL_AND_THE_SWEEP_CROSSING_7_26_26.md. Do NOT wire
   it before the target screen is approved - that is the freeze, and dressing
   rooms from loose tiles against no reference is what the reset exists to stop.
   | interiors_gate extended: the pool is UP-only and every drawn tile traces to
   a UP verdict | the shell/mechanism is done, do not re-litigate it | yes - the
   dressed room is judged as an assembled scene, per TILESETS-ARE-SETS.
-1. [DONE 7/26, CITY] THE CITY TAB DREW WORLD ART SMOOTHED. It never set
   imageSmoothingEnabled at all, so it took the browser default (true) and
   bilinear-filtered every approved tile - worst on 3x phones. Fixed at the
   SOURCE (tools/bohemia_city_tab.py), both at context creation and inside
   fit(), because assigning cv.width/cv.height resets the entire 2D context
   state and silently turns smoothing back on. The ART lane's PIPELINE_DEBT
   exemption in target_screen_gate.py is DELETED per its own terms; that gate
   now holds every surface to the contract with no exceptions (484 checks).
2. MARRY COMMERCIAL (discovered, CITY 7/26). The corner plaza has NEVER been
   registered with the district kit (it never binds K, and the registration sits
   behind a `typeof K` guard that silently swallowed it), so the walked city
   still renders commercial from the LEGACY PREFAB STAMPS — not the canon plaza,
   nothing enterable. Binding K is one line and turns walkable_gate RED: on a
   single W or N street the generator builds only ONE store strip and parking
   fills the rest (drive 61% vs content 30%). Fix the mid-block/single-edge form
   FIRST, then bind K. Full numbers in the module's own head comment + records/
   BOHEMIA_INTERIORS_EVERYWHERE_7_26_26.md. | walkable_gate green with commercial
   swept + interiors_gate proves a plaza store is enterable | the S/corner form is
   approved, do not reshape it | the mid-block plaza form is [PENDING Paolo] per
   the module's own NOTES — surface it as rendered candidates, do not pick one.
3. GARAGE + CRYPT INTERIORS IN THE ALPHA (discovered, CITY 7/26). The engine
   DISPATCHES a building's interior by kind (garage -> multi-deck parking, crypt
   -> vault hall, everything else -> rooms) and world_gate proves it. The alpha's
   STEP-INSIDE renders the ROOMS kind only, so walking into a parking structure
   or a mausoleum gets you a floorplan instead of decks/vaults. Embed
   bohemia_garage.js + bohemia_crypt.js in CITY_B64 (resync tool exists now) and
   branch the render the way the engine branches. | interiors_gate extended to
   assert all three kinds render | engine dispatch is correct, do not touch it |
   the deck/vault LOOK = judge before volume.
4. Interiors everywhere: DONE 7/26 (records/BOHEMIA_INTERIORS_EVERYWHERE_7_26_26
   .md). Left standing: THE UNDERGROUND behind wash's sewer tunnel mouth is a
   LIFE-lane below-grade level, not a room in a footprint. [PENDING — LIFE lane]
5. District volume: next Pocket-City-type gaps that fit the dead world, on
   the KIT, full touchpoint list per the architecture map. | per-district gate
   x6 configs | bespoke strip/casino (Paolo's hand) | new district LOOK =
   judge before volume.
6. (discovered, coordinator 7/25) RIG_B64/PREFAB_B64 byte-lock holes + sync-
   canon gaps (PLOTGEN/POWERGRID/FLOORPLAN/TRANSITIONS). NON-COOK item. |
   new byte-lock gates registered | — | no.
   (CITY 7/26 note: tools/bohemia_city_module_resync.py now re-syncs every
   engine module inlined in CITY_B64 and `--check` reports staleness, which is
   the freshness half of this item for the CITY app. It caught commercial +
   suburb + district_kit all silently behind. The remaining half is the same
   treatment for RIG_B64/PREFAB_B64.)

## COMBAT
1e. DONE 7/26 (v81): THE QUANTIZED FREEZE - pick-list item 2, on his word
   ("Lets freeze the game for that snappy satisfying feelings then"). Law:
   laws/BOHEMIA_ADDENDUM_THE_QUANTIZED_FREEZE_7_26_26.md. Every freeze is a NOTE
   VALUE derived from BEAT (1/16 graze, 1/8 hit, 1/4 KILL = one whole beat, 1/2
   last man). A killshot is a REST IN THE MUSIC. Directional shake decays INSIDE
   the freeze. ONE arming function, named tiers only.
   *** AND IT UNCOVERED A REAL BUG: the old hit-stop counted FRAMES, so every
   impact in the game was running at HALF WEIGHT on a 120Hz phone, which is what
   Paolo has been judging feel on. ***
   Gate section 17, 335 checks, and the invariant REJECTS the old frame counts.
   STILL OPEN FROM THE JUICE PASS (item 2 of the pick-list is only PARTLY done -
   the freeze and the shake landed, these did not): PERMANENCE (casings, impact
   scars and blood persisting for the encounter - Vlambeer rates it top-tier and
   it is nearly free), 1-2px RECOIL/KICKBACK snapping back on the next 16th,
   MUZZLE FLASH + a directional impact burst, a CAMERA THAT LEADS the shot, and a
   ONE-FRAME FLASH reserved for killshots only. All cheap, all quantized, no
   rules change. | gate: every juice duration is a note value | combat demo | no.
1g. *** THE MERGED COMBAT PICK-LIST (both research docs, ONE order). ALL
   [PENDING Paolo] - he picks, then I build. Docs:
   records/BOHEMIA_COMBAT_RESEARCH_TURN_BASED_GRID_7_26_26.md (part one) and
   records/BOHEMIA_COMBAT_RESEARCH_JUICE_VERTICALITY_COMPANIONS_7_26_26.md. ***
   1 THE PROVING GROUND - one GREYBOX arena as an INSTRUMENT not a level:
     two-storey block + stairs + open ledge, hard and soft cover, a long lane, a
     tight room, an open middle, dials for enemy archetype/count, and a toggle
     per juice effect so any one can be A/B'd alone. He asked for this by name
     ("an actual arena map where we test out different AI and the feel of it").
     HIGHEST LEVERAGE: it makes every other item judgeable instead of arguable.
     | gate: the arena exists, every element present, every toggle independent |
     combat demo | Paolo plays = the verdict.
   2 THE JUICE PASS, QUANTIZED - hitstop as a NOTE VALUE (1/16 graze, 1/8 hit,
     1/4 killshot, 1 bar last-man-down) so the freeze IS the 120 BPM clock and a
     killshot is a rest in the music; PERMANENCE (casings, scars, blood stay);
     1-2px recoil snapping back on the next 16th; directional shake decaying
     INSIDE the hitstop; muzzle flash + directional impact burst; camera lead;
     a one-frame flash on killshots ONLY. | gate: every juice duration is a note
     value, no exceptions | combat demo | no.
   3 ENEMY INTENT ON BY DEFAULT (part one item 1). FORESIGHT stops being the
     source of intent and buys something else. | gate: intent shown every turn |
   4 SHOVE AS A REAL ONE-TILE PUSH with collision damage (part one item 4).
     Becomes DEFENESTRATION the moment floors exist. | gate: push resolves
     against occupancy, collision damages both |
   5 AI ARCHETYPES WITH RHYTHMIC SIGNATURES - archetype-specific utility
     FUNCTIONS (not weight tweaks) + a musical tell per archetype (downbeat /
     offbeat / every other bar / reactive). | gate: each archetype's action
     lands on its declared note value |
   6 COMPANIONS ON STANCES - HOLD / PUSH / COVER ME / GET OUT, set once, one
     tap, NEVER per-turn (micromanagement is the named killer), ally acts ON THE
     BEAT. Foundation already RULED (item 0, ally spawn/target/down-never-dead).
     WHO they are and what they say is [PENDING Paolo], contents his.
   7 TWO AND THREE STOREY COMBAT - stairs as chokepoints (one-body-per-cell is
     already law, so a man on a stair is a cork), height beats cover and exposes
     you, ledges drawn honestly (XCOM 1's trap-slopes are the warning). The
     LAYERING law + INTERIOR-MATCHES-EXTERIOR already speak multi-storey; only
     combat does not. HIGH cost, biggest change.
   8 TURN CLOCK = THE SONG'S FORM (part one item 0) - 5 turns, turn N = section
     N, reaches the 0:48 payoff every fight without costing the NEW ENCOUNTER
     song change. Real rules change, HIS call.
1f. [LOGGED 7/26, HE SAID DO NOT CONTINUE] PULSE VOICES sound "elementary school
   hi-hat metronome shit". They borrow each song's kit by design (v75) - which
   worked for sounding like the record and failed for sounding like a fight. The
   answer is a DEDICATED COMBAT PERCUSSION BANK (casings on concrete, boot on
   gravel, door slam backbeat, distant generator). That is a COOK: needs a REUSE
   CHECK against banks/ and HIS ear before a voice is drawn. Do not start it
   until he says. | reusefirst_gate + song_lock | combat demo | yes (thumbs).
1i. DONE 7/26 (v80): SOFT THE WHOLE FIGHT + THE HEADROOM TRIM. Paolo retired his
   own v79 top rung ("forget about it going hard at five kills... a lot of volume
   fighting each other"). HARD_AT=Infinity; AUTO is SOFT forever; his 2/4 rungs
   carry the climb. The volume complaint was measured (16.2 -> 24.2 -> 41.8
   voices/bar, ~+4.1dB into one master with no trim in front of a -14dB limiter)
   and fixed the way a mix engineer would: the master trims 1.00/0.82/0.68 as the
   rungs land, ramped, reset per fight. Net +0.8dB instead of +4.1dB. Master gain
   ONLY - no note, voice or pattern touched. Gate section 16, 316 checks.
1h. *** RESEARCH ON THE SHELF, NOTHING BUILT, ALL [PENDING Paolo]: ***
   records/BOHEMIA_COMBAT_RESEARCH_TURN_BASED_GRID_7_26_26.md - six games (Into
   the Breach, Slay the Spire, XCOM 2, NecroDancer, Divinity OS2, game-feel
   literature), seven ranked ideas, sourced. Top three:
   (a) QUANTIZED HITSTOP: freeze for a NOTE VALUE (1/16 graze, 1/8 hit, 1/4 on a
       killshot) so the impact freeze IS the 120 BPM clock instead of breaking
       it. Cheap, no rules change, biggest feel-per-hour. | gate: every freeze
       length is a note value | combat demo | no.
   (b) ENEMY INTENT ON BY DEFAULT: ITB/StS are built on perfect information;
       Bohemia has it as a perk (FORESIGHT), off. Cheap, UI job. | gate: intent
       shown for every enemy every turn | combat demo | no.
   (c) THE TURN CLOCK = THE SONG'S FORM: ITB fights are 5 turns then the enemies
       retreat. A fixed turn count is a fixed number of BARS, so turn 1 = section
       A ... turn 5 = section D. Reaches the 0:48 payoff EVERY fight without
       persisting anything and without costing the NEW ENCOUNTER song change -
       the v76 problem solved from the other end. Real rules change, HIS call.
   ALSO: widen the timing windows (NecroDancer shipped ~100% leeway because the
   challenge belongs in the TACTICS, not the timing - a warning aimed at my
   55/110ms grades); make SHOVE a real one-tile PUSH with collision damage
   (ITB's best verb is displacement); ENVIRONMENT (elevation, destructible
   cover, Vegas surfaces) is still the thinnest part of the fight; and NEVER add
   a hidden hit roll on top of a good dial press (XCOM's unsolved problem that
   Bohemia already solved) - that one should become a law.
1k. DONE 7/26 (v79): THE PULSE JOINS THE LADDER. Paolo's design, locked and
   shipped same turn. Law: laws/BOHEMIA_ADDENDUM_THE_PULSE_JOINS_THE_LADDER_7_26_26.md.
   0 kills PULSE SOFT / 2 his rung 1 / 4 his rung 2 / 5 PULSE HARD. The pulse
   stops being a parallel system and becomes his ladder's floor and ceiling.
   Keys off _sk so downed men (V71) and the GROOVE chain (v74) both count: a full
   chain reaches HARD with nobody down. Button AUTO->SOFT->HARD->OFF, manual
   still wins. Gate section 16 executes the ladder at every rung (310 checks).
1j. *** [PENDING Paolo] THE OVERWORLD INTENSITY DRIVER. *** He asked how the 2/4
   progression could apply CALMLY outside combat. ANSWERED IN THE LAW ABOVE,
   NOT BUILT. Recommended driver: LIGHT = TERRITORY + CLUSTERED POWER (rung 1
   in lit owned blocks, rung 2 deep in a grid, calm in the dark) because it
   needs no new lore, is visible on screen, and carries the same cargo as two
   men down without violence. The CALMLY half is mechanism and mine: rungs enter
   on a SECTION BOUNDARY with a one-bar fade so it reads composed, not triggered.
   Supersedes/absorbs item 1n (the MUS.layers dead path). Blocked on his ruling.
   | gate: the driver is posted from the world, layers enter on a boundary |
   parent MUS + CITYMUS, a DIFFERENT sequencer from combat | no.
1l. DONE 7/26 (v78): NEW ENCOUNTER = NEW SONG. Paolo RULED OUT the v76 play-out
   swap ("that's so fucking retarded bro"). Deleted outright, no dead flag left.
   The v76 diagnosis was right and the lever was wrong: persisting the song fixed
   the FORM at the cost of the thing the button is for. RULE LEFT BEHIND: a fix
   that trades what the player feels NOW for what they would feel LATER is a BET,
   and it is his to place. Survives: the single pull point (the bag was drained
   twice an encounter), the pulse yield, the corrected measurement.
   COST ON THE RECORD: combat hears ~the first 40s of a song again; the 2:08 form
   and its 0:48 payoff stay unreachable in a fight. ANY future answer must NOT
   cost him the NEW ENCOUNTER song change. [PENDING Paolo] and not mine to retry.
1m. DONE 7/26 (v77): HIS SONGS ARE CANON + SONG LOCK GATE. Law:
   laws/BOHEMIA_ADDENDUM_HIS_SONGS_ARE_CANON_7_26_26.md. Paolo asked whether the
   music work had touched his actual songs. It had not (every body hashes
   identical from 70e2061), but a promise is not enforcement, so the worry became
   a gate the same turn. gates/song_lock_gate.js byte-locks OVERWORLD_SONGS,
   MLOOPS, MFACTIONS, SONG_ARR/ROOT, synthV, drumV, the 7/3 rungs and the klay
   styles against records/BOHEMIA_SONG_LOCK.json. Proven by tampering SLOW
   CREEP's kick and watching the build fail. NOT a ban on new music: the music
   lane runs --write and says why, which puts the change in the diff.
   FLEET NOTE: any lane that legitimately changes a song must now run
   `node gates/song_lock_gate.js --write` in the same commit.
1o. DONE 7/26 (v76): THE SONGS PLAY OUT + THE PULSE YIELDS. Law:
   laws/BOHEMIA_ADDENDUM_THE_SONGS_PLAY_OUT_7_26_26.md. v75 APPROVED BY EAR.
   (a) Corrected my own 4x error: the creepers run 2.17 kicks / 2.33 hats a bar,
   not 0.54/0.58; the gate now DERIVES the unit from stepDur. Placement is the
   sharper finding: nothing kicks on beat 2, one kick in the pool on beat 4.
   (b) His songs are 2:08 arrangements with the FULL section at 0:48, but every
   NEW ENCOUNTER reset them to bar 0, so he only ever heard the first 40s. Combat
   now waits for a full 1024-step pass before swapping, exactly as CITYMUS
   already did in the overworld. V71's bag fix stands; only the frequency changed.
   (c) The floor now YIELDS instead of doubling 11 kicks and 14 hats his songs
   already played.
   *** STILL FROZEN: every timing mechanic in 1v / 1t / v74's chain. ***
   *** [PENDING Paolo] should the 2/4 rungs unlock the MELODY at all, or only
   energy, or should kills FAST-FORWARD the form instead of unlocking it. His
   7/3 LOCKED law owns those rungs; nothing was moved. ***
1n. (discovered 7/26, NOT fixed, needs HIS ruling) THE OVERWORLD KILL LADDER IS
   A DEAD PATH. MUS.layers starts at 0 and the only assignment in the whole build
   is the studio's CALM/2 KILLS/4 KILLS preview buttons, so the four melody-klay
   creepers can never bloom in the city or the run. What drives intensity out
   there is lore. | gate records the single assignment | — | no.
1p. DONE 7/26 (v75): THE FIGHT PULSE. Law:
   laws/BOHEMIA_ADDENDUM_THE_FIGHT_PULSE_7_26_26.md. Paolo froze new timing
   mechanics until the music and the button work together, so the encounter
   music got COUNTED instead of clock-fixed a sixth time: his creepers average
   0.54 kicks / 0.58 hats a bar (four-on-the-floor is 4 / 8), all half-time. He
   was trying to lock to a pulse not in the recording. His songs untouched; a
   combat-only FLOOR under them in the song's own kit (kick on 4, eighth hats,
   backbeat on 2+4), thickening with the groove chain, plus the count is now the
   song's hat instead of a 415Hz UI beep. PULSE: HARD/SOFT/OFF for an honest A/B.
   *** EVERY TIMING MECHANIC IN 1v / 1t / v74's chain IS FROZEN until Paolo
   rules on this. A SECOND rejection ends the rhythm direction for the session. ***
1w. DONE 7/26 (v69): the four rhythm-game pillars - approach ring, graded press
   with a persistent ms strip, the shot plays a note in the song's key, and a
   SYNC tap-calibration. Law + what is still missing:
   laws/BOHEMIA_ADDENDUM_WHAT_MAKES_IT_A_RHYTHM_GAME_7_26_26.md.
1v. RHYTHM AS DIFFICULTY (next, from that addendum): the 52 dial patterns are
   curve shapes, not rhythms. A rhythm game gets harder by getting more
   syncopated, not faster. Author patterns as note values against the bar.
   | gate asserts each pattern's kill moments land on declared note values |
   the PHASE re-bake machinery exists, reuse it | new dial feel = he plays it.
1u. THE WHOLE FIGHT ON THE GRID: the return volley, deaths, steps and camera
   hits are not quantized, so only the dial is musical. | gate proves every
   fight event resolves on a beat | 120 BPM law | no.
1t. A COUNT-IN BAR when an engagement opens, so you enter already inside the
   pulse. | — | do not delay the pop itself | no.
1z. DONE 7/26 (v68, Paolo's 120-BPM-FIRST law): every dial cycle is a whole BAR
   (44% of pattern x difficulty combos could never land the perfect shot on a
   downbeat), the PHASE table re-solved against it, and the press is now a
   REQUEST granted on the beat. [PENDING Paolo] whether the POP should be
   beat-gated too (it would neutralise the ON THE ONE streak reward).
1y. (discovered 7/26) THE DIAL ENGINE HAS NO MASTER. The stamped block says
   "edit engine/bohemia_engine.master.js then re-stamp"; that file and the
   stamper do not exist anywhere in the repo. Either restore a master + stamper
   or delete the misleading header. NON-COOK. | a sync/byte-lock gate for the
   engine block | — | no.
1a. DONE 7/26 (v67, straight from Paolo playing it): dial locked to the AUDIO
   clock + whole-bar cover cycles; suppression turn-based and legible; sprint
   costs stamina and the refill no longer refunds it; sprint/dash mutually
   exclusive with the armed move named on the ring. [PENDING Paolo] the cycle
   rebalance it forced: package 2 slowed 6->8 beats, package 3 quickened 6->4.
0. ALLY-IN-COMBAT foundation (RULED 7/26, companions addendum): the encounter
   system supports friendly combatants on the player's side — spawn, target
   correctly, go down but never permanently die. Mechanism only; WHO joins
   and companion personalities are Paolo's/quest canon. | proven headless: an
   ally fights alongside through the real bus, downed ally never deleted |
   CITY_B64 | no.
1. DONE 7/26 (v66): encounter handoff hardening for the RUN. Contract:
   laws/BOHEMIA_ADDENDUM_RUN_HANDOFF_CONTRACT_7_26_26.md. Quest context in,
   dead/spared/fled out, declared LEAK LIST, cold handoff with the tab never
   opened, READY queue, abort, loud errors, no splash. 5 back-to-back
   EXECUTED headless in combat_lab_gate sections 5-6, plus a real-surface
   Playwright proof. The cold handoff went 12.9s -> 14ms (blocking font).
2. Combat grammar graduation: stack candidates in ONE judge surface. | judge
   reachable from alpha, side-by-side anchors | — | yes (thumbs then build
   the winner).
3. (discovered 7/26, RUN lane's call) The alpha SHELL carries the same
   render-blocking cross-origin font link the combat demo did. Combat fixed
   its own blob only (lane discipline). Same one-line fix, whole-game boot
   payoff: `media="print" onload="this.media='all'"`. NON-COOK.
4. (discovered 7/26) The demo's melee/nerve loop re-rolls `pickRandomFaction`
   twice on a quest handoff (startGame + the shuffle hook). Harmless, same
   distribution, but it is duplicate work on the enter path. NON-COOK tidy.

## CHARACTER  (LANE LAW 7/26: laws/BOHEMIA_ADDENDUM_THE_RIG_IS_LAW_7_26_26.md
## — the rig is the starting point of ALL body/anim work; RIG CHECK mandatory;
## AND laws/BOHEMIA_ADDENDUM_SHADOWS_ARE_SEPARATE_7_26_26.md — shading never
## baked into asset pixels, render-time layer only. First items of the lane's
## next session: the rig-check gate assertion + the shading-separation gate
## assertion, same turn.)
1. (DONE 7/26 -- records/BOHEMIA_BODYVAR_SLIDERS_7_26_26.txt) ONE-RIG VARIATION
   SLIDERS. Shipped with gates/bodyvar_gate.js + a real-browser clip-set sweep.
   The RANGES are now waiting on Paolo's thumb; do not re-cook them, and do not
   wire per-NPC randomisation until he rules on it.
2. Wardrobe: new SHAPES (structure-not-color), taste-filtered before
   surfacing. | structure_gate | — | fresh shapes = thumbs.
3. Music pool volume in approved styles, taste-filtered. | music gates | — |
   fresh songs = thumbs.

## QUESTS — HIBERNATED (Paolo 7/26, laws/BOHEMIA_ADDENDUM_QUESTS_LANE_
## HIBERNATED_7_26_26.md). Do NOT pick up items below; no "quests" sessions
## until Paolo reopens the lane. All shipped quest work stays live and gated.
1. DONE 7/26 (S10-S21 shipped, corpus 9 -> 21, gate hardened with 5 new checks,
   laws/BOHEMIA_ADDENDUM_TWELVE_MORE_CANON_QUESTS_7_26_26.md). Sitting is live in
   the alpha: LIFE tab -> THE 12 NEW CANON QUESTS. Awaiting thumbs.
2. Act-1 main-quest beats from the locked lore (cold open -> flash-flood climax)
   drafted as .bq chains. START by querying records/BOHEMIA_QUESTBOOK_LAW_INDEX.json
   (QUEST STUDY LAW) and cite what you build from. | same bar as S10-S21, plus
   chain continuity proven headless | engine code, the alpha | yes.
2b. (discovered 7/26) The PORTS master is a 1,276-item BUILD QUEUE written for
   Bohemia by name and almost none of it is built. Mine it for the next quest
   batches instead of inventing shapes. NON-COOK triage first: list the ports
   that are already satisfied vs open. | the index makes this queryable | — | no.
3. (discovered 7/26) MULTI-QUEST CHAIN SUPPORT: nothing in the format or the
   runtime lets quest B read that quest A resolved (S09 -> S06 is a chain only in
   prose). Act-1 beats need it. NON-COOK item: a cross-quest flag surface on
   ctx.quests + a gate proving A's ending really opens B. | new gate section |
   the .bq format's no-stat-gates law is untouchable | no.
4. (discovered 7/26) The batch plants unread flags (opened_the_deep,
   aired_the_method, killed_the_token, walked_them_out, owes_the_cartel,
   sold_the_forger). Nothing consumes them. Wiring them to world beats is
   [PENDING Paolo] at the canon level; the mechanism half is item 3.

## SHARED / ANY IDLE SESSION (non-cook)
1. VERDICT TOOLING upgrade per the doctrine: one AGGREGATED judge page across
   lanes grouped by discipline, side-by-side anchors, APPROVE/CBB/KILL
   buttons, kill-reason tags, .txt export. | replaces per-lane judge sprawl;
   gate: the page exists + exports parse | — | no (tooling, not art).
2. [PRIORITY UP 7/26, Paolo direct order — approved-assets-first addendum]
   CANON EXEMPLAR INDEX + KILL-REASON TAXONOMY distilled from banks +
   graveyard post-mortems (machine-readable; cooking tools cite which
   exemplar anchored each cook). | reusefirst-style gate extension | — | no.
3. DRIFT CANARY harness: re-render fixed approved anchors, diff vs blessed.
   | canary gate registered | — | no.
