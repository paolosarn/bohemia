"""INSERT, DO NOT RE-SERIALIZE. Writing the whole registry back through a JSON
dumper re-encodes every other lane's string to whatever escaping this writer
happens to use, and which way that flips depends on who wrote the file last. Two
rounds in a row it produced a diff that touched four other lanes' objects. The
registry rule is never edit somebody else's object, so my object goes in as TEXT
and every byte around it is left exactly as it was found."""
