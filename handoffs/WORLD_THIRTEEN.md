# WORLD THIRTEEN (one file per lane, written only by WORLD THIRTEEN; newest block on top)

WORLD THIRTEEN (11/7, chat 02m, the map's generation and ONE MAP; VAMILY rule 429, asks 492, 504, 505, 507, 508, 509). BUILD 11/7o (ship f5880ae8) -
EVERY HOUSE ON A STREET. BUILT, NOT YET SEEN. Record: records/BOHEMIA_WORLD_THIRTEEN_ONE_TABLE_AND_A_STREET_AT_EVERY_HOUSE_11_7_26.md.
VOTE world13-a-street-at-every-house-11-7 (stage stand_in).
- (1) ONE TABLE, SHIPPED: records/target/bb/map_fight_kinds.json (a modder's file): 88 map kinds, the town's 12 lots, 23 landmarks
  and its wall and two towers, your lot's 10 pieces, the map's 6 house models: storeys (a 1/2/3 mix), in or on the roof (no
  ladder), cover, what blocks, a street in front. engine/bohemia_fight_kinds.js (BohemiaFightKinds) carries it word for word
  (tools/bohemia_world_thirteen_fight_kinds_sync.js writes it). The painter stands each house as tall as the table says on its
  own roll; vbHouseStorey(gx, gy, lot) answers the fight the same storey. Gate gates/the_map_kinds_have_fight_answers_gate.js.
- (2) THE STREETS, SHIPPED: engine/bohemia_overmap.js houseLanes(m) (__A_STREET_IN_FRONT_OF_EVERY_HOUSE__): every house block its
  own street down its middle, joined to a mile street straight on or as a T, a pocket's track out, the trailer park the one
  exception; the painter lays it (the houses case: a sidewalk each side, a row of houses each side facing it, a bulb where it ends);
  the models face it (bohemia_map_houses.js pick, lot 32+). The fight gets it by being cut from the map. Gate
  gates/a_street_in_front_of_every_house_gate.js (22 seeds). Before: 27% of house tiles on suburb boards had a street beside them;
  now 100%.
- NEXT, IN ORDER: 429(h) the map's half (every building, not only houses, on one joined road network, roads 1 to 4 tiles); 429(c)+(f)
  the 15 place boards (fight_ground.json boards place_*) as templates the generator places where that kind of place lands; 429(g)
  the land-use layer; then 429(a) the cut with COMBAT TWO.
- NOTES OWED (in the record, section 5): COMBAT TWO (lay()'s one-in-seven roof can read vbHouseStorey; its board gate's truth now
  reads the house streets, one marked block); RUN (the_map_stands_taller H1 holds the old storey roll, one marked block); COOK FOUR
  (a two- and three-storey house model are owed: the table is 45 in 100 two storeys).
